# About
The user uploads PDF files, which are stored locally and cataloged in an SQLite database. When a file is selected, the user can type in a question related to its content. The backend processes this question by extracting text from the PDF using PyMuPDF (via fitz), and then uses LangChain's RetrievalQA with OpenAI embeddings to provide an answer based on the PDF's content. Answers are retrieved using a vectorized database, facilitating quick and contextually accurate responses.
